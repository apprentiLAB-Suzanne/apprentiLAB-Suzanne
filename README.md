- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Suzanne, apprentiLAB fabmanager. ApprentiLAB is a makerspace for students and researchers of the Conservatoire national des arts et mÃ©tiers, in France.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in : open source projects that either develop or promote sustainability, solidarity, creativity, collective intelligence. 
I am also very partial to all things musical, new instruments and ways to create musical expression.
